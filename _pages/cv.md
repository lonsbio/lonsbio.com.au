How did I get here?

* BEng (Software), University of Melbourne, 2009
* MSc (Bioinformatics), University of Melbourne, 2012
* PhD (degree requirements completed, graduation pending), University of Melbourne, 2020

Along the way I've worked in customer service, web hosting, data analsyis and as a research assistant. After completing my MSc I started my research career in the ARC Centre of Excellence in Plant Cell Walls studying, you guessed it, plant cell walls. This included a year as an RA before commencing my PhD. During my PhD I also worked (scholarships end!) at the MCRI on cancer and kidney projects, and am currently a post-doc at the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre in the Oshlack Lab. 

I always wanted to do one of those visual resumes. Here is a work in progress using a [Visual Resume Shiny App](https://ndphillips.shinyapps.io/Visual_Resume/), and a snapshot of the last decade ("The Bioinformatics Years"):
