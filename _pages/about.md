I am Dr Andrew Lonsdale ([@LonsBio](https://twitter.com/LonsBio)), a bioinformatician based in Melbourne, Australia. 

Check out the [CV](https://lonsbio.com.au/cv/) page for more details on the long and winding road that led me where I am today.  
 
I am currently a bioinformatics post-doc at the [Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre](https://www.petermac.org/).
