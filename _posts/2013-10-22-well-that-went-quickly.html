What seems like only last week but was almost two months ago was a post on what I intended to do given&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.lonsbio.com.au/2013/08/biting-bullets-bpipe-git-and-vagrant.html">I needed Bpipe working under SLURM.&nbsp;</a><br /><br />Long story short - things went well:&nbsp;<a href="https://code.google.com/p/bpipe/source/browse/ReleaseNotes.txt">https://code.google.com/p/bpipe/source/browse/ReleaseNotes.txt</a><br /><br />I'd intended to document the whole process as I went along, but as often is the case, necessity dictates that getting the job done means sometimes neglecting to take the time to record how you did it.<br /><br />Not that I am too regretful. Diving headfirst has been a great refresher in version control and a chance to try Git, as well as try some rudimentary environments using <a href="http://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a> and <a href="http://puppetlabs.com/">Puppet</a><br /><br />I don't think that the saying 'Show, don't tell' really applies to blog posts, but in order to get another post out the door, I'll risk it.<br /><br />My steps in betting a Bpipe SLURM implementation were going to involve (the show):<br /><ol><li>Vagrant (and Chef/Puppet)</li><li>Git</li><li>Bpipe &amp; SLURM</li></ol><div>The tell is:</div><div><ol><li>Vagrant, Puppet and some nasty shell scripts to have a reproducible dev environment for Bpipe: &nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/lonsbio/bpipe-vagrant/tree/master">https://github.com/lonsbio/bpipe-vagrant/tree/master</a></li><li>See 1 and 3.</li><li>Using 1, clone and develop a version of Bpipe that (sort of) works under SLURM!&nbsp;<a href="https://code.google.com/r/andrewlonsdale-bpipe-dev/">https://code.google.com/r/andrewlonsdale-bpipe-dev/</a></li></ol><div>There is still work to do - it is preliminary support only - including adding MPI and SMP support for Bpipe SLURM. This will likely require more work on this (<a href="https://github.com/lonsbio/slurm-cluster-vagrant">https://github.com/lonsbio/slurm-cluster-vagrant</a>).</div><div><br /></div><div>I won't promise to document these next steps, and then forget to as I go head first into doing them</div><div><br /></div><div>However with any luck there will be some more 'tell' soon.</div></div><div><br /></div>
