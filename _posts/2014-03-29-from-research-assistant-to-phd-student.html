This post has been a couple of months coming (cue freak out that PhD is already two months in...) but was inevitably delayed. I had planned a very big post about my decision to start a PhD, what I enjoyed about working as a research assistant and what I was looking forward to with my reactivated student status.<div><div><br /></div><div><div>But, the post was going to have to be perfect, and I'd have to capture everything about the transition so that I could revisit it later on. It was going to be the post that signalled I had started my PhD, but the delay meant that I kept running into friends who were surprised I'd not told anyone! As a temporary solution I posted to the local <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/BGSA.melbourne/">uni bioinformatics group</a> the news and a question:</div><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="color: #141823; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, lucida grande, tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif;"><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19.31999969482422px;">So, friends/colleagues/peers/etc, it has come to my attention that perhaps I haven't brought to everyone else's attention that I've started my PhD. So consider this post me telling you. Any advice from the collective intelligence of the Bioinformatics Graduate Student Association?</span></span></blockquote><div>If you &nbsp;read enough blogs and books about starting and finishing a PhD, 'write every day' is a recurring piece of advice, and it was one of the more frequent responses to my question from my friends. I suppose it's time to take the hint.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DxOGlTBY_WA/UzZC47whsEI/AAAAAAAAAP0/ltwNJj4KtB0/s1600/ra_to_phd.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DxOGlTBY_WA/UzZC47whsEI/AAAAAAAAAP0/ltwNJj4KtB0/s1600/ra_to_phd.png" height="264" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="font-size: 13px;">The most obvious difference between being a Research Assistant (left) <br />and PhD student (right) so&nbsp;far is the size of coffee I can afford.&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div>This post therefore counts as writing, even though it isn't a large amount, and even though it isn't exactly profound, it's done. It's not the perfect welcome to PhD post I'd imagined, but I managed to &nbsp;include the amusing picture about <a href="http://www.keepcup.com.au/">KeepCups</a> that I wanted to and, as I'm about to hit publish, it's off my todo list and I'm thinking about the next thing I'm going to write. Which I guess is the point. &nbsp;</div></div></div>
