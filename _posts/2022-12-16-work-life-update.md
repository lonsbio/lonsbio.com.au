This is a net-zero update to my work/life balance on account of me delaying this post for so long that the change is almost no longer current. But I wanted to update this blog at least once this year, and wanted to normalise that sometimes, work/life balance needs to change depending on your own circumstances.

I've been working full-time for the last 6 months or so. For a mixture of professional and personal reasons it made sense to do so this year; on the professional side, the extra day a week was mostly devoted to preparing for the first (annual?) Computional Biology Research Sprint at Peter Mac.  

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Kicking off our Computational Biology Research sprint. Excited to see what these great ⁦<a href="https://twitter.com/PeterMacRes?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@PeterMacRes</a>⁩ minds can do with PeterMac data and over the next 2 days. <a href="https://t.co/zDRVYqg3xK">pic.twitter.com/zDRVYqg3xK</a></p>&mdash; Alicia Oshlack (@AliciaOshlack) <a href="https://twitter.com/AliciaOshlack/status/1577075360411561984?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 3, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

So from next year (that's ages away, right?) I'll be back to my normal 0.8 FTE, with one weekday of caring.
