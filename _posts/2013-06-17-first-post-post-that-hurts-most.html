The first post, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz2szNKnsXo">as is well known,</a> is the post that hurts the most.<br><br>I find the first post hard&nbsp;because&nbsp;there is a temptation to try and make it a perfect representation of what the blog aims to be: full of&nbsp;interesting&nbsp;content, written for large audience and a valuable resource to others in the field - with a few jokes as well.<br><br>But since none of those things are true (yet), all I can say is that this will simply be a bioinformatics blog with tips, tricks,&nbsp;challenges&nbsp;and (hopefully) solutions that I come across as a bioinformatician.<br><br>My background prior to bioinformatics was in software; I learn more about biology every day, and many posts will be about biological that I learn that I find new or exciting. They may be quite pedestrian to those with a deeper knowledge, but one of the best things about being a bioinfomatican is the exposure to such a wide variety of biological knowledge and I.d like to share that as I go.<br><br>All views expressed are my own etc etc, not those of my employers or groups I am affiliated with etc etc.<br><br><div><br></div>
